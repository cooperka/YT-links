# YT Links

A Google Chrome extension that displays quick, searchable links to "great" YouTube videos.

*Written a long time ago, during the summer of 2011.*

## Installation

To test in a browser, just open `popup.html`. Otherwise you need to zip all the files and upload it your Developer Dashboard in the Chrome Web Store. You can also download the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-links/pkpkkbnjhejofnhcefbdaenmkdclbmal).

## Usage

When you click the icon at the top of your browser window, it opens a list of all the links. You can then type to narrow the results in real time, or hit enter to open the first link.

## History

I thought it would be cool to have a Chrome extension, so I made one! It's basically a glorified button to access YouTube bookmarks. Except you can't modify them unless you upload an updated version to the Web Store then wait for the new version to propagate. Sigh.

Note:
All the code here is (mostly) in its original form, and hasn't been modified since I wrote it in 2011. My eyes bleed while reading it.
